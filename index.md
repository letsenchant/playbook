### Discovery

Our human-centered design process is grounded in the principles of Design Thinking. It's the driving force behind our projects and teams. Designers keep this process alive by helping our teams understand user problems and needs. Together, we collaboratively and continuously ideate, build, and learn.

### Building

The majority of our development practices were first detailed in Kent Beck's classic [Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321278658) and in Gerald Weinberg's [The Psychology of Computer Programming](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0932633420). We've tried its practices and found that using most of the practices most of the time improves the quality of our work and happiness of our team.

### Listen + Learn

The difficult part of measuring is deciding what to track. [Dave McClure's AARRR framework](https://tbot.io/metrics-for-pirates) provides a high-level overview of important metrics. We then use tactics such as event tracking to instrument those metrics.
